# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates:
1. AWS Config
2. AWS Security Hub
3. AWS CloudFormation Guard

### Example vulnerability:
1. AWS Config: IAM policy that allows unrestricted access to an S3 bucket
2. AWS Security Hub: Non-compliant EC2 instance that is not using the latest operating system patch
3. AWS CloudFormation Guard: A security group rule that allows unrestricted access to a database



## Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities:
1. AWS Systems Manager
2. AWS Inspector
3. AWS Security Hub

### Example vulnerability:
1. AWS Systems Manager: Scan for Microsoft Exchange Server that allows remote code execution
2. AWS Inspector: Insecure storage of AWS access keys on EC2 instances
3. AWS Security Hub: Instances running an outdated or vulnerable version



## Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities:
1. AWS Config
2. AWS Security Hub
3. AWS IAM Access Analyzer
4. AWS CloudTrail

### Example vulnerability:
1. AWS Config: S3 buckets are publicly accessible
2. AWS Security Hub: EC2 instance with a security group that allows inbound traffic from any IP address
3. AWS IAM Access Analyzer: S3 bucket policy grants access to an external principal or an AWS account outside of organization
4. AWS CloudTrail: User has modified a VPC security group to allow unrestricted inbound access
