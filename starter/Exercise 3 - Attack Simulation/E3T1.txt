# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.


AWS GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors AWS accounts and workloads for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. GuardDuty collects and analyzes data from a variety of sources, including AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs, to identify threats and security issues.

In our scenario, GuardDuty may have detected the brute force attack against the application server by analyzing network traffic data from VPC Flow Logs. VPC Flow Logs capture metadata about the IP traffic flowing to and from network interfaces in a VPC, including the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocol.

Besides, GuardDuty can analyze this flow log data and apply machine learning algorithms to identify patterns of activity that may indicate a potential threat, such as a brute force attack. In this case, GuardDuty may have detected a high volume of failed SSH login attempts from a single IP address, which could trigger an alert indicating a potential brute force attack.

Overall, GuardDuty provides a comprehensive threat detection and response mechanism that can help organizations identify and respond to security threats in their AWS environments.
