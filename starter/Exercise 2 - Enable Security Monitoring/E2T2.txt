Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.


- Define a security group that restricts access to unnecessary ports and only allows incoming traffic for authorized ports.
- Update the WebAppSG security group to ensure that it only allows unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports.
- Configure the HTTP load balancer to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS and drop HTTP headers for additional security - use port 433 (SSL).
- Use CloudFront distribution to prevent direct access to the load balancer and ensure secure access.
- Ensure that security groups do not use unsecured ports and do not allow all ingress traffic (0.0.0.0/0).
- Enable server-side encryption for S3 buckets to protect sensitive data.
- Enable logging for the ELB to track and monitor traffic.
- Enable logging for load balancers to monitor traffic and improve security.
- Enable the S3 Block Public Access setting to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.
- Create an IAM role with minimal access to the S3 bucket.
- Configure EC2 subnets to not automatically assign public IP addresses to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
- Ensure the S3 bucket used to store CloudTrail logs is not publicly accessible.
- CloudTrail should have encryption at-rest enabled.
- Enable MFA for the root user to increase security.
